## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r}
wages_tidy %>% 
  write.csv("wages_tidy.csv", row.names = FALSE)
=======
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
>>>>>>> 819606f057acde449c84a13a611d24a694c1006a
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
